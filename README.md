## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Project Info : 
**MatchMate App** is built to demonstrate the use of Clean Architecture + MVVM in Android App Development. The app is mainly divided into 3 layers i.e. ```data```, ```domain``` & ```app``` (presentation).
It also showcases the implementation of some of the Modern Jetpack Architecture Component.

With the help of MatchMate Users can accept or decline the connect request and sync in persistent data to be accessible in offline mode.

## üèóÔ∏è App Architecture :
The app is built using a Clean Architecture design pattern. Which consists of three modules as follows :
* [**app**](https://github.com/swapnil-musale/MatchMate/tree/main/app) - This module is responsible for handling user interaction, displaying data and managing the user interface. Usually, this module is decoupled from business logic and communicates with the domain module for accessing any data.
* [**domain**](https://github.com/swapnil-musale/MatchMate/tree/main/domain) - This module contains core business logic and it doesn't contain any platform-related API usage and should only use Java/Kotlin language APIs.
* [**data**](https://github.com/swapnil-musale/MatchMate/tree/main/data) - This module is mainly responsible for accessing data from remote or local sources which is being called from the domain module only.
